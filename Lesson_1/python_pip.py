Installing Pylint

Python3 is installed via homebrew, which means it is externally managed. Trying to install pip packages gives off a warning about creating an virtual environment before installing python packages. Installing a python package in a virtual environment is recommended, as the alternative (installing python packages systemwide) could cause dependency issues.

In short, create a virtual environment for the pip packages, then install the pip packages.
